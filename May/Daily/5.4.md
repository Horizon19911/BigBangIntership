##### How to install OpenJDK Java on Ubuntu 20.04LTS 

##### Step 1 Search for available OpenJDK versions:

Unless you already know which version of OpenJDK you wish to install, then as a first step perform a search of all available packages:

>$ apt search openjdk

##### Step 2 Install OpenJDK:

>$ sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

*OR*

#### 2. Android development environment
+ Install Android Studio
+ Install the Android SDK
+ Configure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable

##### 2.1. Install Android Studio (Ubuntu)
Download it and that To launch Android Studio, open a terminal, navigate to the android-studio/bin/ directory, and execute studio.sh.

>$ cd android-studio/bin

>$ ./studio.sh

Install Android Studio. Choose a "Custom" setup when prompted to select an installation type. Make sure the boxes next to all of the following are checked

+ Android SDK
+ Android SDK Plaform
+ Android Virtual Device


<br>

##### 2.2 Install the Android SDK
Android Studio installs the latest Android SDK by default. Building a React Native app with native code, however, requires the Android 9 (Pie) SDK in particular. Additional Android SDKs can be installed through the SDK Manager in Android Studio.

The SDK Manager can be accessed from the "Welcome to Android Studio" screen. Click on "Configure", then select "SDK Manager".

>The SDK Manager can also be found within the Android Studio "Preferences" dialog, under Appearance & Behavior → System Settings → Android SDK.

Select the "SDK Platforms" tab from within the SDK Manager, then check the box next to "Show Package Details" in the bottom right corner. Look for and expand the Android 9 (Pie) entry, then make sure the following items are checked:
+ Android SDK Platform 28
+ Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image or Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image

Next, select the "SDK Tools" tab and check the box next to "Show Package Details" here as well. Look for and expand the "Android SDK Build-Tools" entry, then make sure that 28.0.3 is selected.

Finally, click "Apply" to download and install the Android SDK and related build tools.

##### 2.3 Configure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable

The React Native tools require some environment variables to be set up in order to build apps with native code.

Add the following lines to your 
> $HOME/.bash_profile

 or
> $HOME/.bashrc config file:

```
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

```
#### 2.4 React Native Command Line Interface

***Installation***

> npm install –g react-native-cli

***Create a new applicaion***

> npx react-native init helloWorld

<br>

#### 2.5 Running your React Native application

 *Run **react-native start** inside your React Native project folder:*

 > cd helloWorld
 > npx react-native start

 <br>

 > ***If you use the Yarn package manager, you can use yarn instead of npx when running React Native commands inside an existing project.***

  **react-native start** starts Metro Bundler, which you can read more about here.

  <hr>

 *On another terminal, run npx ***react-native run-android****
 
> npx react-native run-android
